# Shopping Mall AI-Based Backend Requirement Analysis Report

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Business Model

The AI-based shopping mall backend system is designed to create a robust, scalable, and secure e-commerce platform. It addresses the gap in existing solutions by providing multi-channel sales support, advanced product categorization, personalized customer engagement through AI-driven recommendations, dynamic pricing, and fraud detection. It targets a competitive online marketplace where differentiation via intelligent backend processing is essential.

Revenue is generated through transaction commissions, premium subscription services for sellers, targeted promotions, and payment processing fees. User acquisition strategies include seamless onboarding, omnichannel experiences, and personalized engagement driven by AI.

Key features include secure user roles and authentication, flexible product and inventory management, comprehensive cart and order processing, dynamic discounts and rewards, real-time inquiry and review management, favorites system with snapshot preservation, multi-channel scalability, and compliance with global regulations.

Success is measured by metrics such as monthly active users, transaction volumes, average order value, customer retention, and operational uptime.

### 1.2 Core Concepts

- **Channel**: Distinct platforms or interfaces through which sales occur.
- **Section**: Logical grouping of products, akin to store corners.
- **Category**: Multi-level classification of products, configurable per channel.
- **Snapshot**: Immutable data capture preserving historical state for audit and compliance.
